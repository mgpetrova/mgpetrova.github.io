## Marina G. Petrova, PhD

# Welcome!

I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. I obtained my PhD from the Department of Government, University of Essex in Colchester, UK. 

My research interests include conflict transformation, nonviolent action, political violence, and conflict processes. In my work, I study different types of political mobilization and their determinants, dynamics, and outcomes, using primarily quantitative methods. 

My research has been published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics and International Interactions. 

I am a Conference Organizer for the Conflict Research Society.
